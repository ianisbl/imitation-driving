# Imitating human driving behavior in an urban environment

THis Github is dedicated to a project that was done in CS 230 and CS 236 classes at Stanford University. In this project, we tackled the ambitious challenge of autonomous driving with a specific focus on urban environment. More spefically, our goal was to test and compare the most advanced imitiation learning techniques on Lankershim Bld. (Los Angeles) using data provided by NGSIM (https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/operations/07029/index.cfm). Roadways and vehicle's trajectories were extracted using an updated version of the publicly available Julia package NGSIM.jl (https://github.com/sisl/NGSIM.jl) provided by Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory. The simulation environment also relies on an updated version of the publicly available environment ngsim_env (https://github.com/sisl/ngsim_env). See our paper on the subject :
