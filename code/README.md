# Imitating human driving behavior in an urban environment

In this project, we tackled the ambitious challenge of autonomous driving with a specific focus on urban environment. More spefically, our goal was to test and compare the most advanced imitiation learning techniques on Lankershim Bld. (Los Angeles) using data provided by NGSIM (https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/operations/07029/index.cfm). Roadways and vehicle's trajectories were extracted using an updated version of the publicly available Julia package NGSIM.jl (https://github.com/sisl/NGSIM.jl) provided by Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory. The simulation environment also relies on an updated version of the publicly available environment ngsim_env (https://github.com/sisl/ngsim_env). See our paper on the subject : 

## Generating data

To produce all the files that will be input to our models, you need to use the NGSIM_updated/ folder.

## Getting Started

There are quite a few steps to perform before being able to actually test the models.

1 - First thing to do is to setup NGSIM environmemt. To do this, just move to ngsim_env/ and follow the installation instructions.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

### And coding style tests
